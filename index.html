            <p>Animation movies are a unique and creative form of filmmaking that use animation techniques to bring stories to life. These films can be made using various styles, from hand-drawn 2D animation to cutting-edge 3D animation and even stop-motion. Below is an overview of animation movies, touching on their history, types, and notable films.

                ### **<h2>History of Animation Movies</h2>**
                Animation movies date back to the early 20th century. The first known animated feature film is *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* (1937) by Walt Disney, which was a groundbreaking achievement for animation as a storytelling medium. However, the roots of animation go even deeper, with early pioneers like Winsor McCay's *Gertie the Dinosaur* (1914) and various short films before that.
                
                ### **<h2> Types of Animation</h2>**
                 **<h4>2D Animation</h4>**: 
                   - Traditionally drawn by hand, 2D animation involves creating characters and scenes in two-dimensional space. Famous examples include *The Lion King* (1994) and *Aladdin* (1992).
                   - It can also include digital animation done using software like Adobe Animate or Toon Boom.
                
                 **<h4>>3D Animation</h4>**: 
                   - This form uses computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create characters and environments in three-dimensional space. It has become the dominant form of animation for modern films.
                   - Notable 3D animated films include *Toy Story* (1995), *Shrek* (2001), and *Frozen* (2013).
                
                 **<h4>Stop-motion Animation</h4>**: 
                   - This technique involves photographing physical objects (often clay figures or puppets) frame by frame and moving them slightly between shots to create the illusion of movement. Famous stop-motion films include *The Nightmare Before Christmas* (1993) and *Coraline* (2009).
                
                 **<h4>Hybrid Animation</h4>**: 
                   - A mix of live-action and animation techniques, often seen in films like *Space Jam* (1996) or *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* (1988), where animated characters are integrated with real-world settings.
